# 🫧 Electrochemical Bubble Tracking — Bright & Dark Detection Framework

### 🎯 Overview

This repository presents a computational framework for detecting, tracking, and quantifying gas bubbles generated during electrochemical reactions.  
The system is designed to handle complex visual environments — including bright reflective bubbles and dark shade-like bubbles — using adaptive image processing and trajectory-aware tracking algorithms.

The tracking programs are developed and optimized to analyze electrochemical gas evolution on three electrode systems:
- Bare Ti metal  
- TiO₂ nanotubes (TNT)  
- Carbon-doped TiO₂ nanotubes (CTNT)  

Each dataset corresponds to 30-second electrochemical experiments in Na₂SO₄ electrolyte under constant applied potentials of 5 V, 10 V, 15 V, and 20 V.

## 🧠 Framework Description

| Mode | Optimized for | Core Algorithm | Output |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| ✨ Bright Bubble Tracker | Reflective or shiny bubbles | Threshold + trajectory mapping | bright_bubbles_per_second.csv, annotated images |
| 🩶 Dark Bubble Tracker v5-ID | Diffused or shadow-type bubbles | Background subtraction + motion-aware matching + ID locking | dark_bubbles_new_vs_left_v5.csv, trajectory CSVs |

Both frameworks perform:
- Frame-wise bubble detection  
- Persistent ID-based tracking  
- Identification of newly generated and leaving (upward-moving) bubbles per second  
- Generation of combined plots and annotated visual sequences

## 🎥 Experimental Video Dataset (Flimora Series)

All raw experimental videos are hosted on Google Drive (due to size limits) and correspond to electrochemical bubble evolution under different potentials and electrode types.
